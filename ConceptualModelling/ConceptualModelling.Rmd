# Covid-19 Tracking and Lifestyle Trends Data Mart: Conceptual Modelling

## Questions to be Answered

1. What were the trends, in terms of the number of cases, over time? (Our aim is
obtaining profiles of individuals, by age and gender, who tested positive for
Covid-19; distinguishing between travel-related and other cases (if known);
tracking outbreaks; exploring the types and availability of testing facilities; etc.)

2. Was there any interplay between special events (e.g., Thanksgiving or Canada
Day) and the number of cases? (It should be noted that there is typically a delay
between increased social interactions and an upsurge in positive Covid-19 tests.)

3. How did lockdown measures, such as stay at home orders or school closures,
affect the number of cases? Did specific government announcements or
restrictions lead to downward trends in the number of cases? (The effectiveness
of specific government measures on the outbreak is of importance here. It should
again be noted that there is typically a delay between restrictions and a
decreased in positive Covid-19 tests.)

4. What were the trends in behaviours, in terms of the locations people visited and
the duration they stayed? Did the weather have any impact on these trends? For
instance, studies suggested that many Canadians started bicycling, walking, or
visiting parks during the summer. (This question speaks to the mapping of
potential changes in citizensâ€™ lifestyles. Note that mobility data are available
online from e.g., the google mobility repository and that weather data may be
obtained from Environment and Climate Change Canada.)
